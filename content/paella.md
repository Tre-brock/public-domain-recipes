- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min  
- üç≥ Cook time: 60 min  
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4  

## Ingredients  

- 500 g of bomba rice
- 1 free-range chicken, cut into pieces
- 500 g of rabbit, cut into pieces
- 150 g of flat green beans (*bajoqueta*)
- 150 g of large white beans (*garrof√≥*)
- 2 ripe tomatoes, grated
- 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika
- A few saffron threads
- 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
- Salt to taste
- 1.5 liters of water
- (Optional) 6 artichokes, chopped
- (Optional) 500 g of cleaned snails

## Directions  

1. Heat the olive oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and rabbit pieces and fry them until golden brown on all sides.

2. Add the green beans and *garrof√≥* to the pan. Saut√© the vegetables with the meats for a few minutes so they absorb the flavors.

3. Stir in the grated tomato and cook until it reduces and the oil separates, indicating it is ready.

4. Sprinkle the sweet paprika over the mixture and stir well, being careful not to burn it to avoid bitterness.

5. Pour the hot water into the pan and bring it to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes to let the flavors blend and create a rich broth.

6. Evenly distribute the rice across the paella pan. Add the saffron threads and adjust the salt if needed.

7. Cook over high heat for 10 minutes without stirring the rice. Then, lower to medium-low heat and continue cooking for another 8-10 minutes, until the rice absorbs all the broth and is perfectly cooked.

8. If desired, place a few sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the rice during the last few minutes of cooking for extra aroma.

9. Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and let the paella rest, covered with a clean cloth, for 5 minutes before serving.
