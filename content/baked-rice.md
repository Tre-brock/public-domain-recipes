- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min  
- üç≥ Cook time: 60 min  
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4  

## Ingredients  

- 400 g of bomba rice
- 150 g of cooked chickpeas
- 500 g of pork ribs, cut into pieces
- 200 g of pork belly, cut into pieces
- 2 blood sausages (*morcillas de cebolla*)
- 1 medium potato
- 1 large tomato
- 1 whole garlic head
- 100 g of crushed tomatoes
- 50 ml of extra virgin olive oil
- 800 ml of hot broth (preferably from stew)
- 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika
- A few saffron threads
- Salt to taste

## Directions  

1. Preheat the oven to 220¬∞C (428¬∞F), using both upper and lower heat.

2. Peel the potato and cut it into 1 cm thick slices. Set aside.

3. In a clay casserole (oven-safe), heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the pork ribs and pork belly until golden and crispy. Remove and set aside.

4. In the same oil, lightly fry the potato slices until golden. Remove and set aside.

5. Sear the blood sausages for a few minutes, being careful not to break them. Remove and set aside.

6. Stir the sweet paprika into the remaining oil, mixing quickly to avoid burning. Add the crushed tomatoes and cook until the oil separates from the sauce.

7. Mix in the cooked chickpeas and rice, stirring for a couple of minutes so the rice absorbs the flavors.

8. Return the pork ribs, pork belly, and potato slices to the casserole, evenly distributing them over the rice. Place the whole garlic head in the center and arrange the blood sausages and tomato slices on top.

9. Pour the hot broth into the casserole, ensuring it covers all ingredients. Add the saffron threads and adjust the salt if needed.

10. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all the broth and is tender.

11. Once done, remove from the oven and let the baked rice rest, covered with a clean cloth, for 5 minutes before serving.
