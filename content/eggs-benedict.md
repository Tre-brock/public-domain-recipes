## Ingredients

- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- Cayenne pepper or hot sauce, to taste (optional)
- 4 eggs
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 2 english muffins or toast, split
- 4 slices of Canadian bacon or ham
- Butter, for spreading on muffins (optional)
- Chives, finely chopped (optional)

## Directions

1. **Blend Yolks and Lemon Juice**: In a blender, blend the yolks and lemon juice to create the base for the hollandaise sauce. This can optionally be done in a double boiler on a gentle simmer with whisking instead of blending to reduce curdling.
2. **Drizzle Butter**: Slowly pour in the melted butter while blending. The sauce should thicken and become creamy. If it becomes too viscous, add a little warm water or lemon juice to thin it out.
3. **Season Sauce**: Season to taste with cayenne pepper or hot sauce.
4. **Heat Water to Simmer**: Prepare a large saucepan with at least four inches of water and bring it to a gentle simmer. Add the vinegar to help the egg whites set.
5. **Poach Eggs 3-4 Minutes**: Gently slide the eggs into the simmering water. It helps to crack the eggs into a small bowl or ladle, bring the vessel to the surface of the water, and then drop the egg in that way. While cooking, take a spoon and stir the water into a little whirlpool; this can help displace the excess egg whites, giving the poached eggs a cleaner, firmer appearance. Cook for 3-4 minutes.
6. **Remove Eggs**: Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
7. **Toast Muffins**: Halve the muffins and toast them. Optionally butter both halves. You could substitute the muffins with any kind of spongey bread.
8. **Cook Bacon**: In a skillet on medium heat, cook the Canadian bacon or ham until slightly browned.
9. **Assemble**: Place a slice of Canadian bacon on each toasted muffin half, top with a poached egg and a generous amount of hollandaise sauce. Garnish with cut chives and more cayenne pepper if desired.
